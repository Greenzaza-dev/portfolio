About Me
Hi! I'm GreenZaza (JavaLukas), a passionate Minecraft developer who loves creating custom features for servers while keeping the gameplay fun and balanced. I specialize in plugin and script development for Spigot/Paper servers, with a focus on vanilla/semi-vanilla experiences. I'm always eager to work on new projects, help server teams, or contribute to communities.
My Skills

Java: Experienced in developing custom Minecraft plugins using the Spigot/Paper API. I can create efficient, lightweight plugins for features like custom commands, events, tools, and optimizations.
Skript: Highly proficient with Skript – perfect for quickly building custom commands, GUIs, events, anti-grief systems, and quality-of-life improvements on servers that use the Skript plugin.
HTML & CSS: Skilled in building clean, responsive websites (e.g., server websites, player dashboards, rules pages, or application forms).
Python: Working knowledge for creating Discord bots, automation scripts, tools, or data handling related to Minecraft servers.

What I Can Offer
I enjoy helping Minecraft servers improve their quality and player experience. Whether it's adding small custom features, optimizing performance, creating a professional server website, or setting up Discord integrations – I'm dedicated and reliable. I'm open to staff, developer, or builder roles on vanilla/semi-vanilla servers.
Feel free to reach out if you'd like examples of my work, code samples, or to discuss a project!
Thanks for reading!
